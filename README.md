Maze AI Pathfinding Using NavMesh Algorithm
=================================================

This project focuses on creating a maze, implementing an AI component, and scripting an AI agent to navigate through the maze using the NavMesh algorithm. The AI will autonomously find the shortest path to reach the destination.

## Key Features
- [x] üß© **Maze Generation** ‚Äì Design a structured maze layout for AI navigation
- [x] üó∫Ô∏è **NavMesh Pathfinding** ‚Äì AI finds the best path dynamically using navigation mesh
- [x] ü§ñ **AI Agent Movement** ‚Äì The AI character automatically follows the derived path
- [x] üéÆ **Game Scene Integration** ‚Äì Interactive environment for testing AI navigation
- [x] üìå **Custom Register Number Placement** ‚Äì Add your register number to personalize the scene

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment: .**:
- Install Unity or another game engine supporting NavMesh
- Ensure NavMesh Components are enabled

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Sandhit06/LLM-Semantic-Book-Recommender.git
    ```

3. **Run the Simulation**:
- Open the project in Unity
- Press Play to test AI movement in the maze
